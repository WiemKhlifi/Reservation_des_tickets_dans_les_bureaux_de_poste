# Ticket_reservation_in_post_offices
In my first year of the engineering cycle, I presented an online ticket reservation system for post offices in order to put my knowledge and professional skills in object-oriented programming (c++) to use.
My work involves developing an application to manage the online reservation of tickets by customers who have a postal account at a special counter.
